# Another-Motion-Picture-Review-Classifier
This is going to be a Bayesian movie review classifier. It will classify movie reviews as either positive or negative reviews.
I'm starting this project with a friend. We coded the first part of the project together and made a simple Naive Bayesian Model to get familiar with the idea of creating a Naive Bayesian Model. From here we are optimizing the model/project on our own.
